# Dev Log: Day 1 - Frontend Takes Flight (Sort Of!)

Alright team, Day 1 is in the books!

So, what went down on the frontend side today? I, Developer B, was on Phase 0 duty, basically setting up the initial playground.

### Today's Wins (Frontend Phase 0 - Nailed It!):

*   **Project Started:** Got the whole React + TypeScript thing spinning with Vite. It's like the turbo booster for React apps, apparently. Also pulled in some key players: `firebase` (our direct line to Google Auth), `socket.io-client` (for when things get real-time later), `uuid` (to make sure everyone and everything has a unique ID), and `react-router-dom` (for making pages show up when you click stuff).
*   **Testing Arena Ready:** Set up Vitest, JSDOM, and React Testing Library. This means we can actually write little code tests now. Wrote a super simple one just to make sure the whole testing setup wasn't secretly broken. It passed! *Phew.* Test-first, baby! Gotta follow the plan.
*   **Firebase Connected (Kinda):** Plugged in the Firebase client SDK configuration. It's initialized and ready to talk to Google Auth when Phase 1 hits. Just waiting on Developer C for the proper environment variables so it doesn't spill our secrets.
*   **Pages & Navigation Born:** Built the very basic structure with `react-router-dom`. We now have concept pages like a Home, Login, Dashboard, and a placeholder for the actual Board view. You can click links (or type URLs) and see different (empty) screens!
*   **Style Foundation:** Threw in some basic CSS to make it look less like a default browser page and slightly more "clean and professional" like Teams. It's just a sketch right now, but it gives us something to look at.
*   **First Real Test Passed:** Wrote a test using React Testing Library specifically for the main `App` component to ensure it renders the basic layout and navigation links. It passed, which means the fundamental structure isn't completely messed up! ðŸŽ‰

### Current Status:

We've got routing on the frontend! You can navigate between different pages, but they are just empty shells right now. Zero actual functionality coded yet.

So far, nothing has spectacularly broken. Let's all collectively cross our fingers and hope it stays that way as things get more complex!

Next up on the list is **Phase 1: User Authentication**. Time to get people actually logged in!

I'm seriously hyped to tackle this next challenge. As the legendary Barney Stinson would say:
